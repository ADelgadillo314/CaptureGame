This is the version 1.0 of my Capture Game for my website coming out soon! Basically A User (yourself) can go to the page where this game will be hosted and play against the AI i created or make it a two player game. 

# Game Rules: 
1. Start: Players can pick any position on the board to start. (Preferably not in the path of the other team).
2. The players then take turns moving there Token to difference positions on the board. A Token can move in any direction much like a queen in chess. 

3. Each Spot that you moved from becomes a "Wall" and cannot be crossed in the future. 

4. A Player Wins if the opponent does not have any more moves available to Him:

*X will lose in his next turn because there are no more moves available for them!
5. A Player Wins if the opponent crosses there path on His/Her Turn.

X will lose because it is O's turn and O will strike him down!
Enjoy!
